# Coding Challenge: MRF Generation from Claims File OON Rates

## Introduction

As part of the Transparency in Coverage (TiC) regulations, health insurers are required to publish their allowed amounts monthly in a machine-readable format. This challenge involves building a React application that facilitates the generation of these Machine-Readable Files (MRFs) from a CSV file containing claims data.

You will create an interface that allows users to upload, parse, validate, and approve claims data. The approved data will then be sent to a backend API to generate JSON MRF files, which will be stored on the server on disk.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note for Candidates

This coding challenge is designed to identify exceptional talent and is not intended for everyone. We are looking for candidates who can demonstrate outstanding problem-solving skills, efficient coding practices, and a deep understanding of modern web dev concepts.

**Time Constraint:** While we understand that creating a full-featured application takes time, we expect top candidates to be able to complete a significant portion of this challenge within a couple of hours. Your ability to prioritize features, make smart design decisions, and produce high-quality code quickly is key.

**Focus on Core Functionality:** If you find yourself running out of time, focus on implementing the core features and demonstrating your coding prowess rather than trying to complete every aspect of the challenge. We value quality over quantity.

**Showcase Your Skills:** Use this opportunity to highlight your strengths. If you excel in certain areas (e.g., state management, API design, UI/UX), make sure to emphasize those in your implementation.

Remember, this challenge is as much about how you approach problem-solving and manage your time as it is about the final product. Good luck!

## üìù Submission Guidelines

- **Provide a forked repository link** containing your project. Make sure it is public or add @mihilmy as a collaborator.
- Include a **`README.md`** file with clear instructions on how to set up and run your application locally.
- Ensure all dependencies are listed, and any setup scripts or configuration files are included.
- Your code should be **well-organized** and **easy to navigate**.
- Please look into the [RUBRIC.md](./RUBRIC.md) for our evaluation criteria

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries to Use

- **UI Components**: [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) (do **NOT** design components from scratch).
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (use Tailwind classes for styling).
- **State Management**: [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) (use one file for all state management).
- **CSV Parsing**: [Papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/) for parsing CSV files.
- **Data Tables**: [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) for displaying data in tables.
- **Routing**: [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for handling routes.
- **Schema Validation**: [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for validating claims data.
- **API Interaction**: Use `fetch` or any other library for API calls.
- **Storage**: Store generated MRF files on the server in a local folder.

## üìã Instructions

### 1. TiC Compliance for Allowed Amounts Publication

- Understand that under the TiC regulations, health insurers must publish their allowed amounts monthly in a machine-readable JSON format. The format is publicly documented [here](https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide/tree/master/schemas/allowed-amounts).
- This application will aid in generating these JSON MRF files from a CSV file containing claims data.

### 2. Build an Interface for CSV Upload

- **Create a user interface** that allows users to upload a CSV file of claims.
- **Use Mantine components** for building the interface (do not design components from scratch).
- The interface should include:
    - A file upload button.
    - Display of the selected file name.
    - Error handling for incorrect file formats.
    - A table of all the claims that the user will approve.

### 3. Parse, Validate, and Present Claims Data

- **Use Papaparse** to parse the input CSV file on the frontend. A sample has been included under `data/sample.csv`
- **Validate the claims data** against a defined schema (you need to define a high-quality schema for the claims data).
- **Handle parsing and validation errors** gracefully by informing the user of any issues.
- **Present the parsed and validated data** to the user using AG Grid in a tabular format.
- Allow the user to **approve** claims before submission.
- BONUS: Allow the user to **edit** or **remove** claims as well.
- BONUS: Secure this page with a dummy authentication system. Only authenticated users can access this page.

### 4. Interact with Backend API for JSON MRF Generation

- **Define a high-quality schema** for the data to be sent to the backend API.
- **Implement a function** to send the approved claims data to the backend API.
- The backend API will **convert the data into JSON MRF files** and store them on the server in a local folder.
- The format is publicly documented [here](https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide/tree/master/schemas/allowed-amounts). You will simply run averages on each provider, procedure, place of service, billing class combination to generate the file.
- This is the bulk of the project, I expect you to use good design patterns from here: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog to manage the generation of the final file.
- If there are missing required fields such as TIN. You can ignore them.

### 5. Fetch and Display List of MRF Files

- **Create an API endpoint** that fetches the list of generated MRF files for each customer.
- **Display the list** on a page similar to [this example](https://my.clearesthealth.com/mrf/ehs).
- **Create a public page** that displays the list of MRF files fetched from the API.

### 6. Application Design Documentation

- **Create a markdown file (`DESIGN.md`)** that explains the entire application architecture and functionality.
- Include details about:
    - Overall application flow.
    - Components and their responsibilities.
    - State management using MobX.
    - Interaction with the backend API.
    - Routing and navigation.

### 7. Code Organization and Best Practices

- Organize your code into appropriate folders:
    - `components/` for reusable components.
    - `pages/` for page-level components.
    - `stores/` for MobX state management (use one file for all state management).
    - `services/` for API calls and backend interaction.
    - `utils/` for utility functions.
- **Maintain high code quality** with proper spacing, comments, and meaningful naming conventions.
